# My Homepage

This is a private repo for my public homepage. I believe a homepage is a developer's self portrait, so I hope to one day make this a perfect representation of myself. Till then, this is a living website that I'll make incremental improvements on until I feel satisfied with the outcome.

## Setup

Install necessary software:
* [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run the applicaton:
```
npm start

## Deploy

Once code is pushed to the repo, it is automatically deployed to the production [website](www.austinfullwood.com).

To deploy the backend:
```
